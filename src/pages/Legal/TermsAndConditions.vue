    <p>
      Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully
      before using the {{ systemUrl }} website (the "Service") operated by
      {{ appName }} ("us", "we", or "our").
    </p>
    <p>
      Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of
      and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users
      and others who access or use the Service.

      you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the
      Service.

    <p class="text-h5">Self hosted</p>
    <p>
      {{ appName }} provides you with the code to create your own
      implementation, {{ appName }} is not responsible for possible failures,
      functionalities or parts that do not work.
    </p>
    <p class="text-h5">Subscriptions</p>
    <p>
      Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
      ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
      periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly
      basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
      renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or
      {{ appName }} cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either
      through your online account management page or by contacting
      {{ appName }} customer support team.
    </p>
    <p>
      A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to
      process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide
      {{ appName }} with accurate and complete billing information including
      full name, address, state, zip code, phone number, and a valid payment
      method information. By submitting such payment information, you
      automatically authorize {{ appName }} to charge all Subscription fees
      incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, {{ appName }} will
      issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,
      within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the
      billing period as indicated on the invoice.
    </p>
    <p class="text-h5">Fee Changes</p>
    <p>
      {{ appName }} will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
      change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
      Subscription before such change becomes effective.
    </p>
    <p class="text-h5">Accounts</p>
    <p>

      constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate
      termination of your account on our Service.
    </p>
